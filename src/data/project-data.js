        description: " This is my pet project â€“ an adaptive landing page created to showcase my web development skills. The project uses HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create a stylish and responsive interface. I applied React and React Hooks to manage state and build reusable components. For routing, I used React Router, enabling smooth transitions between different pages. The project is fully responsive, thanks to adaptive layout techniques nd the use of Bootstrap. This website is a great example of my experience in developing modern and efficient web applications.",
